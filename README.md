# Coverage Issue: heapOutOfMemory 
While being used with jest --coverage on Docker with workflows.

Branches:
Main - Original Heap Out of Memory Error
v8-coverage-error - Provides better error messaging
solution-a - See solution A below
solution-b - See solution B below
solution-c - See solution C below

Solution A: Do not use Docker at all for running jest tests, just use npm on workflows. Docker is unecessary for me here and I missed this obvious fix.

Solution B:  Keep using docker but use a working directory `WORKDIR '/app'` in your dockerfile and then reference it in jest.config.js `roots: ['../', '/app']`.

Solution C: Add `ignoreCoveragePathPatterns: ['/opt/']` in jest.config.js.
